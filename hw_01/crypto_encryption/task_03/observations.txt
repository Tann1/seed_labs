I used aes-128-cbc with a 12-byte IV to encrypt the body of pic_original
and the result was good. Good in a sense that it's hard to tell what the 
original image was and since our goal was to hide this original image i'd say
that the job was well done. In contrast, aes-128-ecb which doesn't use an IV did a poor job hiding the original pic. It was blurry and still easy to tell what the original image was from the encrypted version of aes-128-ecb.
